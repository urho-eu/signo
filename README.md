## Signo Home Care

Signo Home Care is a watch app that sends alerts if a fall was detected
based on accelerometer readings.

The companion app (for Android only, at the moment) is also able to send
 alerts or call predefined numbers in case of emergencies.

### Backend

An online demo can be found here: [Signo Home Care](http://signo.urho.eu/).
This demo only works with preconfigured watches, so your watch might not
be able to interact with it (yet :).

### Installation

Grab [Signo](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/...)
from the app store using the Pebble app on your smartphone.
